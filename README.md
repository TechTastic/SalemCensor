Welcome to the **Salem Censor** bot Github!

This is simply a quick and dirty bot I made while i was burned out on another project of mine!
What it does is simple!

1) A Message containing a swear is send to the Discord server
2) It takes this message and runs a lot of regular expressions to find the swears
3) It then replaces each swear with its less vulgar counterpart
4) It deletes the original message and sends the sanitized message in its place using the original message's author's avatar and name
5) It sends a DM to the author of the original message telling them what was censored

This list of swears and their counterparts come from this [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wH6ifBlHfFnY8dsKtuRv42QZ8rgTi7NiUG4jyIA0qH8/edit?gid=0#gid=0) listing the changes made in the game **Town of Salem**, hence the bot's name!

I will likely update the bot and list over time but for now it does its job adequately enough for me!
